# Java Programming Learning Guide

## Overview
Welcome to the Java Programming Learning Guide! This guide is designed to help beginners and intermediate learners understand Java, one of the most popular and widely used programming languages. Java is known for its portability, object-oriented approach, and vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks.

## Prerequisites
Before starting with Java, it is recommended that you have:
- A basic understanding of programming concepts (optional but helpful)
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system
- A code editor or IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code

## Installation
1. **Download the JDK**: Install the latest Java Development Kit (JDK) from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or use an open-source version like OpenJDK.
2. **Set Up Environment Variables**: Ensure that the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is set correctly.
3. **Choose an IDE**: Install and configure an IDE such as:
   - IntelliJ IDEA
   - Eclipse
   - NetBeans
   - VS Code with Java extension
4. **Verify Installation**:
   ```sh
   java -version
   javac -version
   ```
   If these commands return the installed version of Java, the setup is complete.

## Learning Path
### 1. Basics of Java
- Hello World Program
- Data Types and Variables
- Operators and Expressions
- Control Flow Statements (if, switch, loops)

### 2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java
- Classes and Objects
- Constructors and Methods
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation and Abstraction

### 3. Core Java Concepts
- Exception Handling
- File Handling
- Multithreading
- Collections Framework
- Generics

### 4. Advanced Java Topics
- JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
- Networking in Java
- Java Streams and Functional Programming
- Java 8+ Features (Lambdas, Streams, Optional, etc.)

### 5. Frameworks and Libraries
- Spring Boot
- Hibernate
- JavaFX (for GUI applications)
- Testing with JUnit

## Hands-On Practice
- Solve Java coding challenges on platforms like LeetCode, CodeChef, or HackerRank.
- Work on small projects like a calculator, to-do list, or a simple REST API using Spring Boot.
